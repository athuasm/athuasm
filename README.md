### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Mohini Sauhta and I am a graduate from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill that double majored in Quantitative Biology and Biomedical Engineering. I am currently attending Columbia University of Law in pursuit of a Juris Doctor degree.

Please feel free to take a look at my repositories to see programming-related projects that I have worked on!
